## It Only Takes 10,000 Hours

In his book [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), Malcom Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task for 10,000 hours, or 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. Although the 10,000-Hour Rule is oft-debated, we can all agree that practicing for 10,000 hours will - at the very least - make you quiet adept at any skill.
